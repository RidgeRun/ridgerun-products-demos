# LIBCUDAISP

CUDA ISP is a RidgeRun library developed to provide an out-of-the-box image processing algorithms, focusing on easiness and performance. Since our library's CUDA algorithms run on the GPU, it reduces CPU usage, thus freeing its processing capacity for others applications. This library can also work with computers that do not have a built-in ISP, by adding a discrete GPU to the computer architecture
