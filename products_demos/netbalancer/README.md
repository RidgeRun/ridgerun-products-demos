# GstNetBalancer

GstNetBalancer is a RidgeRun product that implements a network balancing strategy as a GStreamer element so that it can be integrated into the network streaming end of a pipeline. GstNetBalancer is independent of the rest of the pipeline so any previous processing is not affected. GstNetBalancer also does not affect the receiver side of the stream since the protocol remains standard and no modifications are made to the network packets.
