# GstQtOverlay

GstQtOverlay is a GStreamer plug-in that renders QT graphics on top of a video stream. The rendering occurs directly into the GStreamer video frame buffer, rather than in physical graphics memory, with the resultant video having the QT graphics image merged into the video image. With the RidgeRun GstQtOverlay element, GUIs will be available not only at the video display but also embedded in file recordings and network streaming, for example.Â
