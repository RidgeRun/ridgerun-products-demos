# CUDA UNDISTORT

CUDA Accelerated GStreamer Camera Undistort takes a distorted source from a camera and transforms it so that the output looks as true and correct as possible as if no distortion lenses were used. This product it's implemented as a GStreamer element so that you can integrate it into your pipeline for any other further needed processing. It transforms the input images in such a way that the distortion is no longer detected.
